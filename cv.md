## **Brief information about me:**
I am 25 years old and at this age I realized that I wanted to challenge my inner humanitarian. 
Having good logic, a little experience with graphic editors, a great love for the Internet and the ability to absorb a large amount of information, I decided to learn FrontEnd. Being firm in my intentions to become a developer, I independently searched for information on the Internet regarding the basics of HTML,CSS and JavaScript. But over time, I realized that I needed a more clear learning structure and that when studying independently, I found gaps in knowledge. I am good at organizing processes, have creative thinking, and easily establish interpersonal communication. In my humble opinion, I am a good strategist. 
I’m just at the beginning of my training and have no experience at all, but I think that after receiving hard skills I will become a super cool specialist.
